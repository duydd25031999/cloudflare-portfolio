                        I began my journey as a web developer in 2015, and since then, I've continued to grow

                        along the way. Now, in my early thirties, 7 years after starting my web development
                        journey, I'm building cutting-edge web applications using modern technologies such as
                        Next.js, TypeScript, Nestjs, Tailwindcss, Supabase and much more.
